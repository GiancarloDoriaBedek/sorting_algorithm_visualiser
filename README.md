## Description

A simple sorting algorithm visualizer made in python using tkinter library.
It allows user costumisation of data set by setting the size of an array and its maximal value (minimal value is always 0). It also features an animation speed slider which allows users to choose a delay value between each step of an algorithm.


#### Implemented Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

python sorting_algorithm_visualizer.py
```
Once the application window has opened, on the top portion are options to choose different sorting algorithms, options to set up a data set and a time delay option. While setting up a data set click "Generate" button to view random data visualized on the bottom portion of the window. After it's all set up, click "Start" button to start sorting.
